*** Loopy Research Routes ***

Animal Loopy- Jellyfish stuff
- Biology papers, animal behavior and evolutionary behavior 
- Investigating translational behavior (break radial symmetry to pick direction), predator vs prey
- Formalization of lunacy paper (jellyfish), biggest limitation is it needs to know loopys morphology (how many lobes). Including joint angles into neural net may help
- How to go from perception to actuation 
- Snake robots, sea flat worms, sea slugs 
- How will Loopy decide head vs. tail??
- Different forms of waves, second order, pulses, spherical....
- CPGS (central pattern generators)

Plant Loopy- Light and heat stuff
- Biology papers, plant behavior, simulated annealing, evolutionary behavior
- Light rule- how to include light feedback into the system
- What experiments to design? It is hard to find a baseline, how will we justify that these results are GOOD? (How to be unique and convincing without comparison?)

General topology loopy by investigating boundary conditions
- How does this change Loopy's behavior and morphology?
- Can be tied into animal and plant loopy

Other options
- Finite element analysis (FEA)
- Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)

*** TODO ***

Continue to understand the model and morphogens

Investigate similar phenomena found in nature/ phenomena that can be applied to Loopy 

Read Loopy citations 

Octopus primitive model

Snake robots, Cflat worms, c slugs

Watch a video on non-linear dynamics, hopf bifurcation, limit cycles (key word)- Do this first

Read about Fitzhugh-Nugamo model 

Stuff in slack!

Work on what you know think about what you do not know
