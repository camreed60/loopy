Morphology: The study of form and structure

Swarm of One - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10342118&tag=1&tag=1
    Motivation: Bottom up robot morphology design through self-organization and morphological computation
    Inspired by morphogenesis in nature 
    Polymorphic robot testbed that can be viewed as a robotic swarm and a single robot
    Loopy can form symmetric shapes consisting of lobes, with the number of lobes influenced by initial noise and dynamic parameters
    Loopy is a closed chain of identical rotary actuators acting as independent agents
    Reaction-diffusion equations (specifically the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model), are used to determine Loopy’s shape through the interaction of active, inhibitor, and passive morphogens
    First experiment shows parametric effects of activator diffusion rate and diffusion ratio on the number of lobes formed by Loopy
    Second experiment analyzed Loopy’s response to run-time changes in parameters and the hysteresis (delayed) effect observed
    Discusses properties of the emergent bodies, including radial symmetry, morphological computation, and “inertia” to shape change
    Future work: Exploration of extracellular environments and the simultaneous generation of morphology and behavior

Loopy Movements - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15187
    Studying emergent, decentralized movement in multicellular robots, drawing inspiration from the rotation of sunflowers
    Loopy faces unique challenges in achieving coordinated motion due to its homogenous, physically interlinked cells and lack of specialized components or directional friction
    3 questions
        How do Loopy’s rotational motions emerge from local interactions?
        What role does Loopy’s morphology play in its movement?
        How resilient is this approach to individual component failures?
    Use of simulated chemical system with reaction, diffusion, and active transport (similar to plant behavior) for achieving emergent behavior in Loopy
    Fitzhugh-Nagumo activator-inhibitor model and a purely diffusive morphogen for creating sinusoidal morphological distributions that drive Loopy’s shape and motion
    Active transport, modeled as a wave equation, maintains continuous motion by propagating morphogen distributions and thus the robots shape around the cellular chain
    Discretization of the governing partial differential equations for decentralized implementation, allowing each cell to operate using only information from its immediate neighbors 
    Four experiments conducted to analyze Loopy’s rotation under various conditions, including changes in wave speed, lobe size, the number of lobes, and simulated actuator failures
    Vicon markers used for tracking individual cell positions and the calculation of angular velocities from this data
    Four demonstrations:
        Demonstration of rotation
            3 lobed Loopy was subjected to step changes in wave speed
            Observed non-rigid body dynamics with inner valleys rotating faster than outer peaks, contrary to typical rigid body motion
            Highlights linear relationship between wave speed and angular velocity, with cells rotating opposite to the overall morphology
        Lobe size experiment
            Analyzed impact of lobe size on Loopy’s rotation
            Cessation of rotation when lobes disappear and minimal variation in cellular angular velocity across different lobe sizes
            Constant angular velocity of Loopy’s morphology relative to its cells, regardless of lobe size
            Ability to redistribute its rotation between cellular and overall morphology rotation by altering lobe size
        Number of lobes experiment
            Investigates the impact of the number of lobes on rotational behavior
            Increase in cellular angular velocity as the number of lobes decreased, with no environmental rotation observed in a five-lobe configuration
            Constant angular velocity of Loopy’s morphology relative to its cells, independent of number of lobes
            Connection between number of lobes and their size due to Loopy’s fixed length, affecting cellular angular velocity
        Actuator failure experiment
            Evaluated Loopy’s resilience to both sequential and random actuator failures
            Loopy maintains rotation until approximately one third of its actuators fail
            Difference in rotational behavior between sequential and random failure modes, with the former exhibiting a critical failure threshold while the latter showed gradual degradation
            Increase in turning distance and gradual degradation of morphology as motors fail, plateauing when half the motors are disabled 
    Summary: demonstrates the emergence of rotation in Loopy from decentralized local interactions and its resilience to significant component failures
    Future work: Focusing on physical improvements to Loopy, the investigation of translational movements, and the exploration of more complex terrains with obstacles
